    <h1><b>Data science</b></h1>
    <hr />
    <p><i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i></p>
    <p>Not to be confused with Information science or Computer science.</p>
    <p><b>Data science</b> is an interdisciplinary academic field<sup>[1]</sup>
     that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, 
     scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge 
     from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.<sup>[2]</sup>
<br /><br />
<mark>Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain</mark>
 (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).<sub>[3]</sub> Data science is
  multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research
   method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.<sub>[4]</sub>
<br /><br />
<u>Data science </u>is "a concept to unify<del>statistics, data analysis, informatics, and</del> 
their related methods" to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[5]
It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of
mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.[6] 
However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing 
Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science 
(empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about 
science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.[7][8]
<br /><br />
A data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical
knowledge to summarize data.[9]</p>
